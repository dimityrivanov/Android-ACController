# Android-ACController
Is a mobile application that connects with the ACController unit over SSDP in the same local area network.



# Roadmap
  * Make ac brand list dynamic comming from a restAPI instead of hardcoding it into an array
  * Add support for more than one ACController device
  * Clean code
  * Change device for brand list its not sexy right now
  * Think of smarter way to send the state than pressing an label / textfield
